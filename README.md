# Gatsby Template

A fork I made to [gatsby-starter-default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default), and configured to work with `Typescript` and `styled-components` off the bat.  
This is a great starter for a gatsby project, since it's basically gatsby's default starter, only with some nice tools you would probably consider adding anyway before starting to write you code.

You can go to the official gatsby docs for more info regarding how to run, and the meaning of some of the files in the root directory.

Enjoy!
